# Pokedex Quiz Website
**STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

This project is a simple quiz to name the pokedex in order (Or randomly) based on pokedex number 
## Motivation
I enjoy doing the pokemon quiz on sporcle [such as this one](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/pokemon) and wanted to do a similar quiz but for the pokedex. [Pokemon Quiz](https://pkmnquiz.com/) does have something similar but there is no option for a randomized pokedex, just in order.

## Features
- A hint system (Gives the first and last letter of the pokemon or a silhouette of the pokemon)
- A point system (I want to see my score increase as I get better without using hints)
- A mode for in order pokedex and random order

## Usage
- You can visit the website [here](https://rannerjp.github.io/pokedex-quiz/)
